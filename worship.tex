\chapter{Directory for the Worship of God}

\section{Preamble}
This directory\index{Worship!directory!directory} seeks to avoid the extremes of being so rigorous as to be
viewed as a liturgy\index{Worship!public!liturgy!not imposed}, or so loose\index{Worship!directory!balance
between liturgy and looseness} that it serves no purpose. There are some matters it contains that may be
inconsistent\index{Worship!directory!possible inconsistency with scruples of some} with the
scruples\index{Office bearers!subscription!scruples} of every office bearer\index{Office bearers:office-bearers
``f20!} due to the various opinions concerning the relationship between the gifts\index{Office bearers:functions vs
gifts ``f20!}, functions, and\index{Office bearers:functions ``f20!} offices\index{Office bearers:offices ``f20!} that
Christ has instituted for the Church. Nevertheless, we hope that it will be received in the spirit of the directory
produced by the Westminster Assembly\index{Westminster:Assembly ``f20!}, which wrote:

\textit{{}``Albeit we have not expressed in the Directory every minute particular which is or might be either laid aside
or retained among us, as comely and useful in practice, yet we trust that none will be so tenacious of old customs not
expressly forbidden, or so averse from good examples although new, in matters of
lesser}\index{Worship:directory:matters of lesser importance ``f20!}\textit{ consequence, as to insist upon their
liberty}\index{Worship:directory:not insist on liberty ``f20!}\textit{ of retaining the one or refusing the other,
because not specified in the Directory, but be studious to please others rather than themselves.'' }


\section{Introduction}

\index{Bible!standard!for the Church}God has established and revealed in the Bible how to publicly worship him.\mfn{\bv{Hebrews}{12:28}; \bv{Genesis}{4:3-8} with \bv{Hebrews}{11:4}; \bv{Exodus}{20:2-6}; \bv{Exodus}{25:40}; \bv{Leviticus}{10:}; \bv{ISamuel}{15:22}; \bv{Matthew}{15:1-14}; \bv{Deuteronomy}{12:8}; \bv{Deuteronomy}{17:3}; \bv{Colossians}{2:8-10, 16-23}.} To add to or subtract from what God has commanded is not acceptable, because it introduces human traditions and leads to unnecessary divisions in the Church.\mfn{1 Corinthians 4:6; 1 Corinthians 11:2, 16; Matthew 15:9; Colossians 2:8-10, 16-23; Ephesians 4:2-3.} Therefore, the Lord
s Day public worship is to be comprised of only those elements and ordinances instituted by the Lord Jesus Christ\index{Church!Christ!rules} as given through the prophets and apostles.\mfn{Jeremiah 19:4-5; Colossians 2:18-23.} Under the New Covenant instituted by the Lord Jesus Christ, public worship is no longer connected with the physical temple, Levitical priests, animal sacrifices, Levitical choirs, or the use of musical instruments, that were all commanded by the Lord through Moses and David in the Old Covenant.\mfn{Leviticus 23:4, 37; Hebrews 9:1-10, 24; 1 Chronicles 6:31; 1 Chronicles 15:16; 1 Chronicles 23:5; 1 Chronicles 25:1-6; 2 Chronicles 5:12; 2 Chronicles 7:6; 2 Chronicles 29:25-30.} These types of ordinances have passed away, leaving the Church with the simplicity of congregational worship ``in spirit and truth.''\mfn{John 4:21, 23-24; Hebrews 12:27-29; Acts 7:48; Acts 17:25.} 

When it comes to public worship, the Church needs to consider: 

\begin {enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
\item There are the elements, that is, those things which are essential to the public worship; and there are circumstances of public worship, such as where to worship and at what time, etc. 
\item The elements are clearly expressed either by command and example in Scripture or by good and necessary consequence may be deduced from Scripture. 
\item The circumstances are not explicitly set forth in Scripture and are decided upon at the discretion of a church session, remembering that all things should be done decently and in order.\mfn{1 Corinthians 11:13-14; 1 Corinthians 14:26, 40}
\end {enumerate}

\section{1. Lord's Day Public Worship Services}

\subsection{General Principles of Public Worship}
\begin {enumerate}[label=1.\arabic*]
\item The Lord expressly calls and commands his people to draw near to him, for the sacred duty and high privilege of public worship each Lord's Day, as it is a \index{Sabbath}Sabbath of solemn rest and holy convocation to him.\mfn{\bv{Leviticus}{23:3}; \bv{Acts}{20:7}; 1 Corinthians 11:17-18, 33-34; 1 Corinthians 14:23, 26; Hebrews 10:25.}
\item Under the Old Testament, God established a pattern of Sabbath day morning and evening worship.\mfn{Numbers 28:1-10.} In the New Testament, the Lord Jesus seemingly supports this same pattern by meeting with his disciples both in the morning and the evening on the Lord's Day.\mfn{John 20:19.}  Moreover, the Lord sanctified the entire Lord
s Day to himself and in it gives his people a foretaste of their eternal enjoyment of him and his glorious Kingdom.\mfn{Exodus 20:8; Hebrews 4:9; Hebrews 10:25.} Therefore, the congregation should ordinarily assemble for public worship in the morning and evening on the Lord's Day. The specific times and locations of each service, as a circumstance of worship, are left to the discretion and wisdom of the session.
\end {enumerate}

\subsection{The Elements and Ordinances of Public Worship}
\begin {enumerate}[label=1.\arabic*]
\setcounter{enumi}{2}
\item The elements and ordinances of New Testament public worship prescribed and instituted in the Scriptures are: a call to worship,\mfn{Genesis 4:26; 1 Corinthians 1:2; 2 Timothy 2:22.} prayer,\mfn{\bv{ITimothy}{2:1}; Philippians 4:6.} reading the Word,\mfn{Acts 15:21; Colossians 4:16; \bv{ITimothy}{4:13}.} preaching the Word,\mfn{\bv{ITimothy}{4:13}; \bv{ITimothy}{5:17}; 2 Timothy 4:2.} hearing the Word, congregational unaccompanied singing of Psalms,\mfn{2 Chronicles 29:30; Matthew 26:30; 1 Corinthians 14:26; Ephesians 5:19; Colossians 3:16.} observing the sacraments,\mfn{1 Corinthians 11:33-34.} giving of tithes and offerings,\mfn{Genesis 14:18-20; Psalm 96:8; 1 Corinthians 16:2.} the giving and taking of oaths and vows, and a benediction.\mfn{Numbers 6:23-27; 2 Corinthians 13:14.}
\item All elements and ordinances are to be observed in a manner consistent with Christ's prescription as revealed in the Scriptures, being a clear application of our Lord's command, ``Teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you.‚Äù\mfn{Matthew 28:20; 1 Corinthians 4:6; 1 Corinthians 11:2.}
\end {enumerate}
